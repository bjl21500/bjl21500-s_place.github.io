## Good Day! Welcome to my place!




My name is Briana and I am 2nd year MPH student in Epidemiology pursuing 
a certificate in Infectious Disease Epidemiology.

This is a site where you can learn a little bit about me. I plan to post some
of my work (my track record if you will) to show how far I've come and 
where I my talents can potentially take me.
