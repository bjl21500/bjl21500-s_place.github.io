# Hello Hello


I do have a hard science background and somehow found my way to public health.
I've done some research, interned at a local government, and even attended a few 
conferences prior to attending graduate school. To get some more in-depth 
bacground information on me, check out my resume below. Also, take a look at
my flexdashboard page to see some of my work with plots.
